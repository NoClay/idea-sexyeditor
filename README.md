# IntelliJ Sexy Editor

Editors are so booooring. White background. Black background.
<Choose-your-color-here/> background. Meh.

Not anymore! With **Sexy Editor**, your IntelliJ IDE will become...
err... sexy! By choosing one or more background images, your
everyday IntelliJ editor gets _super beautiful_. 

But that's not all! It doesn't have to be just a pretty image.
Put a motivational quote of your choice, instead! By simply looking
at it, _every hour_ of every working day, you will soon become
whatever you are striving for! 

## Examples

Or, what you can use to make IntelliJ sexy:

+ awesome picture of yourself;
+ embarrassing photo of your colleague;
+ funny photo of your dog;
+ cute photo of your cat;
+ logo of your favorite sports club;
+ good looking ppl, to help you staring at the code all day;
+ photoshot of your secret crush;
+ hotkeys for your ide;
+ photo of your mom (please, don't!);
+ motivational quote;
+ photo of you boss (bonus guaranteed!)
+ ...

Wait! You can set multiple backgrounds! They can change like
a slideshow, or they can change randomly.
