# IntelliJ Sexy Editor

Editors are so booooring. White background. Black background.
<Put-your-color-here/> background. Meh.

Not any more! With **Sexy** editor, even your IntelliJ IDE will become...
err... sexy! If you wonder how an editor can become sexy, just don't -
simply install the plugin :)

And then what? You can put any image as editor background! Like:

+ awesome picture of yourself;
+ embarrassing photo of your colleague;
+ funny photo of your dog;
+ hot girl, that keeps you motivated to stare at the code all day;
+ hotkeys for your ide;
+ photo of your mom or wedding (please, don't!);
+ motivational quote
+ ...

That is not all! You can set multiple backgrounds! They can change like
slideshow, or they can change randomly.
